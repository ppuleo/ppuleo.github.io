<p>I led the UI team from 2014 to 2017 building this complex application with <a target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs" target="_blank">RxJS</a>, and <a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3</a>. The UI is a modular single-page application that includes complex components like virtualized data grids, user-configurable chart widgets, SQL editors, and file readers with validation.</p>
<p>X15 was acquired by FireEye in January 2018 where this product lives on as FireEye Data Explorer.</p>
