<p>The <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> Trailer app is the first demonstration of a mobile ad publishing workflow in the N2 web publishing system I codeveloped at Subatomic Systems. The app is built around a fully responsive swipe interface that rivals the perfomance of native apps. Like previous technology previews, the Star Trek Into Darkness Trailer app includes photo galleries, HTML5 media players, social integration, and offline capability.</p>
