summary:    The 20/20 Experience App started out as the last in a series of technology previews based on Neutrino that I developed with Subatomic Systems. Similar to the Skyfall Trailer App, this touch-optimized HTML5 application includes an HTML5 audio player, HTML5 video, an advanced swipe-based content gallery, multi-directional embedded swipe and gallery views, and context-triggered animations.

<p>The 20/20 Experience App started out as the last in a series of technology previews based on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kcirb/neutrino/overview" target="_blank">Neutrino</a> that I developed with <a href="http://subatomicsystems.com" target="_blank">Subatomic Systems</a>. Similar to the <a href="/work/projects/skyfall-trailer-app">Skyfall Trailer App</a>, this touch-optimized HTML5 application includes an HTML5 audio player, HTML5 video, an advanced swipe-based content gallery, multi-directional embedded swipe and gallery views, and context-triggered animations.</p>
<p>With the 20/20 Experience App, I continued refining and improving the swipe-based components, optimizing transitions and animations for device, and developing view management strategies to cope with memory contraints in mobile browsers.</p>
<p>After completing the app in Neutrino, I led an effort to rewrite the app in AngularJS, incoporating data-driven content and a new OOCSS framework. The AngularJS app grew into the first demonstration of Subatomic Systems&#39; N2 publishing platform.</p>
