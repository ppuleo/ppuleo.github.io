summary:    The Institute for Humanities Research (IHR) site is an updated and reorganized Drupal 7 site that replaces a Drupal 5 site I deployed in 2007. To help visitors navigate and understand the IHR's complex research and service offerings, I designed custom page templates and content type color-coding for each top-level section specifically adapted to the section information structure.

<p>The new Institute for Humanities Research (IHR) site is an updated and reorganized Drupal 7 site that replaces a Drupal 5 site I deployed in 2007. To help visitors navigate and understand the IHR&#39;s complex research and service offerings, I designed custom page templates and content type color-coding for each top-level section specifically adapted to the section information structure. The new site features several rotating slideshows, interactive carousels, and complex tabbed views to help organize the content and engage the visitors. &nbsp;</p>
