<p>When I moved to San Francisco, I stayed in a Travelodge for a few weeks while I looked for a reasonable apartment in the city (Pro tip: there&#39;s no such thing). With spotty Wi-Fi and only 3 TV channels, I was understandably bored out of my mind.</p>
<p>To commemorate that awful stay, I made this memory matching game with all of my least favorite amenities. Give it a try or go stay in a Travelodge to play for real.</p>
