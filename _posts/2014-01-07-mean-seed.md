summary:    In my spare time, I've been putting together a seed project based on some of the work I've done at Flare with the MEAN stack. It started as a learning experience, to see if I could simplify all of the boilerplate code needed to set up user signup, authentication, password resets, email confirmations, etc. but keep enough flexibility so the project could be easily configured and expanded.

In my spare time, I've been putting together a seed project based on some of the work I've done at [Flare](http://flare.is) with the MEAN stack. It started as a learning experience, to see if I could simplify all of the boilerplate code needed to set up user signup, authentication, password resets, email confirmations, etc. but keep enough flexibility so the project could be easily configured and expanded. Though it will probably be a perpetual work in progress, here it is: the MEAN seed! See it on github: [https://github.com/ppuleo/mean-seed](https://github.com/ppuleo/mean-seed).
