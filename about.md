<img class="philhead" alt="Phil's Head" src="/images/philhead-big2.png" /> Hi there. I'm Phil Puleo and this is my fancy website.

I'm a front-end/full-stack web application developer specializing in rapid development with [mongoDB](http://mongodb.org), [Express](http://expressjs.com), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), and [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (a.k.a., the [MEAN stack](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)).

My development experience ranges from hand coding responsive, standards-based HTML/CSS and JavaScript to crafting object-oriented application logic in node.js, PHP, and ASP.NET C#, to developing database schemas and architecting complex applications.

Want to read even more insanely boring acronym lists? Awesome, then check out my [résumé](/images/puleo_resume.pdf).
